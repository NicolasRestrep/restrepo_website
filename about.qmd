I am post-doctoral researcher in the Anthropology Department at UC Davis. I am interested in how cultural animals (human and nonhuman) adopt habits and beliefs, how these develop and change across their lifetime, and how they are transmitted across networks. I am especially interested in how these micro-level processes scale up to aggregate patterns of cultural change. To answer these questions I use longitudinal data, social network analysis, simulations, and formal models. I also love Bayesian statistics, music, and football (soccer).
